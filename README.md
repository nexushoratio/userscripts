# userscripts
[Userscripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript), often called Greasemonkey scripts, are a form of [augmented browsing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_extension).

What I may write will probably be here.

Userscripts are available through many browsers with the installation of an addon known as a [userscript manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Userscript_manager).  Often there are several to choose from.  [Greasemonkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greasemonkey) was the first one, hence the moniker Greasemonkey scripts.

I do most of my browsing using [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) and use the [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) userscript manager.  I do minimal testing across different combinations of browsers and managers.

Any scripts I write can be found on [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/users/1139937-mike-castle-nexus).[^1]
