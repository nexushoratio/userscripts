# LinkedIn Tool

Minor enhancements to [LinkedIn](https:///www.linkedin.com). Mostly just hotkeys.

The major reason for this userscript is to provide keyboard navigation to LinkedIn.

A secondary reason is, being my first userscript, it provides me with a platform to learn HTML, JavaScript, CSS and other web technologies.

Mostly it works by mapping keystrokes to mouse event (e.g., hitting a key sequence results in a mouse click), or causing the page to scroll a bit of content into view.

## Installation

* Via [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/472097-linkedin-tool)
* Via [GitHub](https://github.com/nexushoratio/userscripts/raw/main/linkedin-tool.user.js)

After installing and reloading the LinkedIn web page, hitting the `?` key will bring up a help menu.

## Versioning

~~Currently I am using a [SemVer](https://semver.org/) inspired scheme of `x.y.z`.~~

I am replacing SerVer with single strictly increasing numbers.  I have dropped down to two digits for the moment.  Likely once I get issue https://github.com/nexushoratio/userscripts/issues/106 to the point of tracking releases, I will switch to single digits.
