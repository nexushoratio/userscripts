# LinkedIn Tool

Minor enhancements to LinkedIn. Mostly just hotkeys.

The major reason for this userscript is to provide keyboard navigation to LinkedIn.

A secondary reason is, being my first userscript, it provides me with a platform to learn HTML, JavaScript, CSS and other web technologies.

Mostly it works by mapping keystrokes to mouse event (e.g., hitting a key sequence results in a mouse click), or causing the page to scroll a bit of content into view.  It currently does not collect or save any information, though future enhancements may provide some customization which would require that.
